# NgxGuildy

Framework for making page-builders in Angular. Inspired by [craft.js](https://craft.js.org/).

[Demo](https://github.com/antonsimola/ngx-guildy)

Documentation is on its way, in the meanwhile you can study the demo project.

Any suggestions or pull requests welcome


To run the development server:

run `start:lib` and then in another terminal `start:demo`


## Todo
- [ ] Multiple ng-select, and restrict the component
- [ ] Nicer way to register components (would be nice with just decorator, but then build optimizer thinks component is not used)
- [ ] Docs
- [ ] Provided hover, selected styles by the consumer
- [ ] Selected component wrapper, like craft.js front page demo 
- [ ] Nicer way to provide initial components (however this seems to limit possibility: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8277)
